Files and tools used for the development and implementation of the HAIWIRE card game

[Instructions](./docs/DigitalVersionInstructions.md) for how to set up your own digital version of HAIWIRE are available under docs.

## HAIWIRE Short Play* Rules

1. Draw an Incident card and read it aloud to the group.
2. Discuss the Incident and formulate a group response strategy for ±2 mins.
3. Draw the appropriate number of Inject cards specified on the Incident Card, and read the first Inject aloud to the group.

|If you draw a ... |then `i` = |
|---|---|
|:green_circle: **Green** Incident Card |`2` Injects|
|:yellow_circle: **Yellow** Incident Card|`3` Injects|
|:red_circle: **Red** Incident Card|`4` Injects|

4. Discuss the Inject, updating or reformulating your response strategy, for ±2 mins. 5. Then roll a D10 (ten-sided gaming die).

|If you roll a... | then... |
|---|---|
|1-7|the response failed; Inject card persists, putting you in peril of HAIWIRE; play the next Inject card|
|8-9|the response partially succeeded; discard the Inject card you just discussed and then play the next Inject card|
|10|the response completely succeeded; HAIWIRE averted; draw a new Incident card|

Alternatively, if you have a D6 (six-sided die) on hand, use the following table:

|If you roll a... | then... |
|---|---|
|1-4|the response failed; Inject card persists, putting you in peril of HAIWIRE; play the next Inject card|
|5|the response partially succeeded; discard the Inject card you just discussed and then play the next Inject card|
|6|the response completely succeeded; HAIWIRE averted; draw a new Incident card|

6. Repeat steps 3-5 until you've played all Inject cards for this Incident, at which point the round is complete. Reflect on your responses. Then return to Step 1 and begin a new round by drawing a new Incident card, if desired. 

*[Extended Play Rules](./docs/PhysicalDeckInstructions.md) (which incl. the Conscience role) are outlined separately. 

## HAIWIRE Content Warning

Note this card game incl. real-world AI incidents drawn from https://incidentdatabase.ai/, which players may find uncomfortable or upsetting. We acknowledge that every player brings unique life experiences, and as such, we have color-coded cards so that AI Incident cards describing injury/grievous bodily harm/risk of death appear in red. In addition, please note that several HAIWIRE Inject cards (with grey backgrounds) and Incidents with yellow and green backgrounds also involve uncomfortable or upsetting subject-matter.

Before playing, please designate a card dealer who can make situationally appropriate judgment calls attuned to the life experiences and emotional triggers of each of the players. This may include replacing an Incident or Inject card before reading it aloud. HAIWIRE vests the card dealer with full discretion. Please use it appropriately.
