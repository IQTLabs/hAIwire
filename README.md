## hAIwire Short Play* Rules

1. Draw an Incident card and read it aloud to the group.
2. Discuss the Incident and formulate a group response strategy for ±2 mins.
3. Draw the appropriate number of Inject cards specified on the Incident Card, and read the first Inject aloud to the group.

|If you draw a ... |then `i` = |
|---|---|
|:green_circle: **Green** Incident Card |`2` Injects|
|:yellow_circle: **Yellow** Incident Card|`3` Injects|
|:red_circle: **Red** Incident Card|`4` Injects|

4. Discuss the Inject, updating or reformulating your response strategy, for ±2 mins. 5. Then roll a D10 (ten-sided gaming die).

|If you roll a... | then... |
|---|---|
|1-7|the response failed; Inject card persists, putting you in peril of hAIwire; play the next Inject card|
|8-9|the response partially succeeded; discard the Inject card you just discussed and then play the next Inject card|
|10|the response completely succeeded; hAIwire averted; draw a new Incident card|

6. Repeat steps 3-5 until you've played all Inject cards for this Incident, at which point the round is complete. Reflect on your responses. Then return to Step 1 and begin a new round by drawing a new Incident card, if desired. 

*[Extended Play Rules](./docs/PhysicalDeckInstructions.md) (which incl. the Conscience role) are outlined separately.
