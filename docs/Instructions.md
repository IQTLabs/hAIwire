# Version 1 - Specific number of incidents
## Setup
1. Shuffle the Incident and Inject decks seperately
2. Decide on a number (N) of Incidents to play through. In our experience a single Incident corresponds to roughly 15 minutes of play time.
## Incident Phase
3. Draw an Incident Card - The color of this card indicates the severity of the incident which determines the number of Injects (i) that must be played through to successfully complete the Incident:
	   **Low Severity:** 2 Injects
	   **Medium Severity:** 3 Injects
	   **High Severity:** 4 Injects
4. Players will then discuss the Incident and possible reactions to it for roughly 2 minutes, after which the Inject Phase begins.
## Inject Phase
5. Draw an Inject card
6. Players will have 2 minutes to discuss responses and collectively decide on a response to the Inject
7. Roll 2 d6 to determine the success or failure of the response
8. Repeat Steps 5-7 until i number of Injects have been played 
9. Repeat steps 3-8 until N number of Incidents have been successfully completed
