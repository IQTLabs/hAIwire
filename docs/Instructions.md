# Game Objective
- hAIwire is a state of chaos in which your algorithmic decision-making system has caused harm to human beings, and continues to have consequences.
- The game objectives are:
  - avoid hAIwire at all costs, **and**
  - resolve the Incident (and Injects), according to the game instructions below.
-  In practice, this means: drawing an Incident card and then discarding all associated Injects within the time available to you.

# Version 1 - Specific number of incidents
## Setup
1. Shuffle the Incident and Inject decks seperately
2. Decide on a number (`N`) of Incidents to play through. In our experience, a single Incident corresponds to 12-15 mins. of play time.
3. (_optional_) If you have 5 or more players, designate a Conscience of the Community to reflect on how well you addressed, mitigated, and prevented harm. Otherwise, the person who shuffled the Incident deck can take on this role.

## Incident Phase
4. üÉè Draw an Incident Card - The color of this card determines the number of Injects (`i`) that must be played through to resolve the Incident and avoid a state of hAIwire.

|If you draw a ___ |then `i` = |
|---|---|
|:green_circle: **Green** Incident Card |`2` Injects|
|:yellow_circle: **Yellow** Incident Card|`3` Injects|
|:red_circle: **Red** Incident Card|`4` Injects|

5. Players will then discuss the Incident and possible responses to it for roughly :hourglass_flowing_sand: **2 mins.**, after which the Inject Phase begins.
## Inject Phase
6. üÉè **Draw an Inject card.** Players will have :hourglass_flowing_sand: **2 mins.** to discuss responses and collectively decide on a response to the Inject
7. (_optional_) :game_die: **Roll a d10** to determine the success or failure of the response, as follows:

|If you roll a ___ | then ____ |
|---|---|
|1-7|the response failed; Inject card persists, putting you in peril of hAIwire; play the next Inject card|
|8-9|the response partially succeeded; discard the Inject card you just discussed and then play the next Inject card|
|10|the response completely succeeded; hAIwire averted; draw a new Incident card|

8. Repeat Steps 5-7 until `i` number of Injects have been played 
9. Before drawing a new Incident, ask the Conscience (or Dealer) how well the group addressed, mitigated, and prevented harm, incl. harm resulting from the Injects. (See [Conscience Questions]()).
10. Repeat steps 3-9 until `N` number of Incidents have been successfully completed.

# Version 2 - Timed
## Setup
1. Shuffle the Incident and Inject decks seperately
2. Decide on a length of time to play for. Based on our play tests, games of 15, 30, and 45 mins. are good starting points.
3. (_optional_) If you have 5 or more players, designate a Conscience of the Community to reflect on how well you addressed, mitigated, and prevented harm. Otherwise, the person who shuffled the Incident deck can take on this role.

9. Before drawing a new Incident, ask the Conscience (or Dealer) how well the group addressed, mitigated, and prevented harm, incl. harm resulting from the Injects. (See [Conscience Questions]()).
10. Repeat steps 3-9 until time runs out.
