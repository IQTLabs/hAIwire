# Version 1 - Specific number of incidents
## Setup
1. Shuffle the Incident and Inject decks seperately
2. Decide on a number (N) of Incidents to play through. In our experience, a single Incident corresponds to 12-15 mins. of play time.
## Incident Phase
3. Draw an Incident Card - The color of this card determines the number of Injects (`i`) that must be played through to resolve the Incident and avoid a state of hAIwire.

|If you draw a ___ |then `i` = |
|---|---|
|:green_circle: **Green** Incident Card |`2` Injects|
|:yellow_circle: **Yellow** Incident Card|`3` Injects|
|:red_circle: **Red** Incident Card|`4` Injects|

4. Players will then discuss the Incident and possible responses to it for roughly 2 minutes, after which the Inject Phase begins.
## Inject Phase
5. Draw an Inject card
6. Players will have 2 minutes to discuss responses and collectively decide on a response to the Inject
7. (optional) Roll a d10 to determine the success or failure of the response, as follows:

|If you roll a ___ | then ____ |
|---|---|
|1-7|the response failed; play the next Inject card|
|8-9|the response partially succeeded; discard the Inject card you just discussed and then play the next Inject card|
|10|the response completely succeeded; draw a new Incident card|

9. Repeat Steps 5-7 until i number of Injects have been played 
10. Repeat steps 3-8 until N number of Incidents have been successfully completed

# Version 2 - Timed
## Setup
1. Shuffle the Incident and Inject decks seperately
2. Decide on a length of time to play for. Based on our play tests, games of 15, 30, and 45 mins. are good starting points.

3. Draw an Incident Card - The color of this card determines the number of Injects (i) that must be played through to resolve the Incident and avoid a state of hAIwire.

8. Repeat Steps 5-7 until `i` number of Injects have been played 
9. Repeat steps 3-8 until time runs out
